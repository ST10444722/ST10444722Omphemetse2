Assignment 2 Report

Good day my name is Omphemetse Tlhoaele and I will be elaborating more on a few elements regarding the app of which I have developed.

1. Purpose

   The app of which I have developed is called “The Tamagotchi App”. The Tamagotchi App is an app of which was created to generate information given and provide an expected outcome. The Tamagotchi App’s purpose is that it is a child friendly app of which provides you with a specific pet chosen by the developer, of which you as the end user must ensure that the pet is well taken care of in a sense that the pet must be fed, bathed, and be given the opportunity to play. Doing this will ensure that the health, hunger, and cleanliness of the pet is constantly at its full bar. The crowd of which will be using this app are mainly pre-school and primary school students and people of which love pets and love engaging with them and are interested in taking care of a pet and would like to be more engaged with a virtual pet and take good care of it. The reason as to why this app is mostly more suitable to pre-school and primary school students and people who are intrigued by pets and taking care of them as opposed to those who are not, is due to the fact that that this app can be very fun and exciting to the right target. This app will not only give options to feed, clean and play with the pet on the screen but it will also display an image matching the chosen option of either feeding, cleaning and playing the pet to improve its hunger, health and cleanliness.

Intuitive design:

I have designed my app to be extremely user friendly to accommodate different age groups more especially pre-scholars and children therefore making my design is easy to follow as users would expect. To elaborate more on how it is easy to follow my app I will be breaking down my design from top to bottom as seen in the added screen prints above. Starting at the top the design has a welcome page/ introduction which states “Welcome to your Tamagotchi App. My name is Darla.”, reason why it is in bold and is centered at the top of the design is to catch the end user’s attention and make them aware of the name of the app and the welcome page, then at the bottom is a button named “Get Started” which will lead to the next page when clicked. Next, I have added a second page of which displays the picture of the pet at the top of the page and three buttons which state “Feed”, “Clean”, and “Play”. When these buttons are clicked a picture matching the button will be displayed leading to an increase in the progress bar below. Next to the progress bar there is a title of which states what is being improved when the buttons are clicked, so when the ‘Feed” button is clicked the “Hunger” bar increases, when the “Clean” button is clicked the “Cleanliness” bar increases, and when the “Play” button is clicked the “Health” bar increases. On the third page is there an image displayed of the pet eating when the “Feed” button is being clicked and so at the bottom is there a “Back” button that should be clicked to take us back to the second page. On the fourth page is there an image displayed of the pet bathing when the “Clean” button is being clicked and so at the bottom is there a “Back” button that should be clicked to take us back to the second page. On the fifth page is there an image displayed of the pet playing with a toy when the “Play” button is being clicked and so at the bottom is there a “Back” button that should be clicked to take us back to the second page.




Content Prioritisation

For my design I included only the necessary interface elements to make the design less complicated and easy to operate at any given time without being confused as to what is happening. This app and design are simple and straightforward making it a bit unnecessary to add too much to the design so therefore I only displayed the essential content and functionalities the user needs as that is only thing that the design needs in general. 

Legible Text Content

For the design I used the Sans-serif font for all the buttons as it is a normal font of which is clear and read-able. For the welcome page/ introduction I used the Aclonica font as it seems playful and different which will be able to catch the end user’s attention in this case being children. This font gives the welcome page/ introduction a more child-friendly and neat look appropriate for children. The text size is large enough to read as I used different sizes depending on the element. For the welcome page/ introduction I used the size 34sp to catch the end user’s attention and make the information written on the welcome page clear and read-able. For all the buttons and the “Hunger”, “Health”, and “Cleanliness” text views I used 20sp due to the fact that they are elements that are not supposed to catch the end user’s attention but should be able to be read so that the end user knows what to do without an occurrence of confusion.

Make Interface Elements Clearly Visible

I have designed my app to make it simple thus the end users can clearly see all the components on the screen. I have ensured that the space between the buttons is not too much as it could make it seem like the buttons are not working together. I have also ensured that the text view that displays the results of the progress bar has enough space so that the results are properly seen. The space between the welcome information and the picture is close to one another to ensure that they both correlate to one another alongside the button. 

Hand Position Controls

The buttons for the design are situated right next to each other to make easy for the end users to reach for them and so that the purpose of the buttons make sense when next to each other unlike if they are situated far from one another, it can lead to a cause of confusion as to what the purpose of the buttons could be in the app.

Images

For my app I have decided to use four different images in order for the app to work out accordingly. The first image I used in my app is an image of a domestic animal of which I chose as a pet being a cat. This image is first displayed on the welcome page as a representation of what the pet looks like, then after that the same image is then displayed on the second page of which shows the cat that needs to be taken care of. <a name="_hlk165821154"></a>The second image is displayed on the third page of which shows an image of the pet cat eating, this image is prompted by the “Feed” button being clicked. The third image is displayed on the fourth page of which shows an image of the pet cat bathing, this image is prompted by the “Clean” button being clicked. The fourth and last image is displayed on the fifth page of which shows an image of the pet cat playing with a toy mouse, this image is prompted by the “Play” button being clicked. I did not encounter any issues in terms of how and where I would like to place my images. Which the correct constraints being added my images appear as I would like them to making it also clear for the end user to see the images.  In terms of the design principles the top 10 Mobile UX Design principles being: 

1\. One screen = One action

` `2  Ensure intuitive navigation

` `3  Provide user control

` `4  Make the text legible 

` `5  Follow the minimum input rule 

` `6  Create a seamless experience across devices

` `7  Opt for personalization 

` `8  Hand position controls

` `9  Use white space

` `10 Test your design

According to the UX design principles mentioned I made use of “Test your design” as it is very important to test your design and ensure that it is running smoothly without any problems. I also made use of “Make text legible” as if your text is not legible it won’t work out accordingly In the design, and I lastly made use of the “Hand position controls” by ensuring there is enough space between all the elements in the design.
